### Calculating the ratio of colors in the sun using KNN

The color of the solar image is classified using the KNN algorithm, and the ratio of colors is calculated. The sun changes color due to changes in the sun's temperature or coronal hole. We aim to visually identify these color changes and derive them numerically using KNN classification algorithms.

The reason why white has a high percentage of results is because we removed the background and corona region from the sun's image and made the background white. These color-ratio data can be used to predict the future state of the sun and can help predict time series through numerical data. We also classify 10 color data because the current value of K is 10. If you change the value of K, you can get more colorful values.
